<h3>PhD students</h3>

**Nicolas Cuny**, co-supervised with Eric Bertin (LIPhy), develops constitutive models for dense suspensions of elastic particles (like microgels or even emulsions) from their microscopic dynamics. Funded by the IRS grant *RheoSoft* from IDEX UGA.

<h3>Post-docs</h3>

**Shivakumar Athani**, co-supervised with Bloen Metzger and Yoel Forterre (IUSTI, Marseille), models dilatancy effects in sheared frictional suspensions with both particle-based simulations (Discrete Element Method) and continuum theory. Funded by ANR *ScienceFriction*.
